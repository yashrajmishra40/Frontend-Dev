            <h2>About Fluid Typography</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Typography plays a crucial role in web design, affecting both aesthetics and readability. 
                With responsive typography, text automatically adjusts to different screen sizes while 
                maintaining perfect proportions. This creates a seamless reading experience across all devices, 
                from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
                Using modern CSS features like clamp() and relative units, we can create fluid typography 
                that scales smoothly between minimum and maximum sizes. This eliminates the need for 
                numerous breakpoints and ensures text remains readable at any viewport width.
            </p>
